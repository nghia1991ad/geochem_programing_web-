This post is a compilation of the exercises from Chapter 5: Radiogenic Isotopes from the book Geochemical Modelling of Igneous Processes - Principles and Recipes in R language by Vojtěch Janoušek, Jean Hervé Martin, Vojtěch Erban and Colin Farrow.

Many of the parent-daughter dating methods are based on similar principles. The parent (radioactive) isotope decayse to ther daughter (radiogenic) isotope:

$$^{87}Rb\rightarrow^{87}Sr$$
$$^{147}Sm\rightarrow^{143}Nd$$
$$^{176}Lu\rightarrow^{176}Hf$$
$$^{187}Re\rightarrow^{187}Os$$
Do note that while the **I** ratios are measured directly with the mass spectrometer (TIMS or ICP-MS), **R** ratios must be calculated from elemental concentration obtained by isotope dilution, ICP-MS, XRF or other analytcal methods.

The formular based on Faure (1986):

$$\frac{^{87}Rb}{^{86}Sr}=(\frac{C_{Rb}}{C_{Sr}})[2.6939 + 0.2832 \frac{^{87}Sr}{^{86}Sr}]$$

$$\frac{^{147}Sm}{^{144}Nd}=(\frac{C_{Sm}}{C_{Nd}})[0.53151 + 0.14252 \frac{^{143}Nd}{^{144}Nd}]$$

### Calculation of Initial Ratios or Ages
$$I=R(e^{\lambda t}-1)$$
* I: ratio of daughter isotope to a stable, non-radiogenic isotope (e.g: $^{87}Sr/^{86}Sr$, $^{143}Nd/^{144}Nd$ or $^{176}Hf/^{177}Hf$)

* R: ratio of parental isotope to the same non-radiogenic isotope in I (e.g: $^{87}Rb/^{86}Sr$, $^{147}Sm/^{144}Nd$ or $^{176}Lu/^{177}Hf$)

* $\lambda$: decay constant

* t: time (Ma or ka)

However, due to the presence of *common* element present, the formula is modified as:
$$I=I_{i}+R(e^{\lambda t}-1)$$

* $I_{i}$: the initial ratio of common daughter-stable isotope

From this, if the age is known, the isotopic ratios can be easily 'age-corrected' and used in petrogenetic considerations. On the other hand, knowing the initial ratio, we can determined the age by solving for t:

$$t=\frac{1}{\lambda}ln(\frac{I-I_i}{R}+1)$$

#### Exercise 5.1: Initial ratios and ages

The Sr–Nd isotopic study of the Central Bohemian Plutonic Complex (CBPC) (Janoušek et al. 1995) has proven a diversity of sources and processes involved in genesis of individual intrusions and suites. The file contains an excerpt from the data for several granitoid types and two country rocks.

Import the data file into a matrix *izo*, calculate the $^{87}Rb/^{86}Sr$ and $^{147}Sm/^{144}Nd$ ratios and attach them to the matrix as the last data columns.

Design functions yielding Sr and Nd initial ratios; back-calculate these at 350 and 300 Ma ago; can you program a single function with an argument identifying the isotopic system (Sr or Nd)?

Calculate the age of the sample Koz-2 assuming that its initial ratio is 0.705.
