<p>The epsilon Nd (<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{Nd}\)</span>) is a widely used parameter to understand the processes of rock forming, i.e. petrogenetic processes from both geochemical and geochronological approach. By definition, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{Nd}\)</span> is the difference of <span class="math inline">\(^{143}Nd/^{144}Nd\)</span> of rock sample and ‘chondritic uniform reservoir’ at the time in the past T. For a rock of age T, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{Nd}(T)\)</span> is the ‘initial’ value of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{Nd}\)</span>; the value at the time of crystallization of the rock, and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{Nd}(0)\)</span> is the measured value (dePaolo, 1981). We use the same form as in (dePaolo, 1981) as we will the author’s propose of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{Nd}\)</span> curve, therefore, the value of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{Nd}\)</span> is :</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\epsilon_{Nd}(T)=10^4 \left[ \frac{(^{143}Nd/^{144}Nd)_{rock}(T)}{(^{143}Nd/^{144}Nd)_{CHUR}(T)} -1 \right]\]</span></p>
