### Seeking help
Here demonstrate how to seek help in R programing. These keywords include: help(), ?, apropos and example.
```{r}
help(plot)
?plot
apropos("plot") #Commands related to "plot"
example(plot)
```
### Object types

### Numeric Vectors
#### Assignment
Assignment of several items to a vector is done using the combine function c:
```{r}
x <- c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7)
y <- c(x,0,x)
y
```
#### Vector Arithmetic
For vectors, calculations are made using basic arithmetic operators: + - * / ^. The use of these operators for two vectors of the same length is intuitive. In other cases, the elements of the shorter vector are recycled.
```{r}
x*2 #Intuitive operators of same length vectors
x*c(1,2) #Multiply is recycled, i.e. *1 *2 *1 *2 *1
```
#### Functions to Manipulate Numeric Vectors

#### Names
Each vector may have an attribute *names* (the length of the vector and names must be matching)
```{r}
x <- c(3,15,27)
names(x) <- c("Opx","Cpx","Pl")
x
```
#### Generating Regular Sequences
Using *colon*, *seq*, *rep*
```{r}
1:9
seq(30,22,-2)
x <- c(0,1)
rep(x,5)
seq(0,5,length.out = 30) #linspace equivalent
```
### Character Vectors
```{r}
paste("A","B","C",sep=";")
x <- c("A","B","C")
substring(x,1,4)
x <- c("Plagioclase","K-feldspar")
strsplit(x,"a")
```
### Arrays, Matrices, Data Frames
Data frames are data objects with observation as columns and cases in rows, and they can contain of any mode. Matrix is a table-like object with single mode (numeric, most commonly). Arrays are generalized matrices: single mode with any number of dimensions.
```{r}
x <- matrix(1:12,3,4)
x
y <- matrix(1:12,3,4,byrow=TRUE)
y
z <- array(c(x,y), dim = c(3,4,2))
z
```

```{r}
x
cat("Number of rows",nrow(x),"\n")
cat("Number of columns", ncol(x),"\n")
t(x) # transpose of x
x%*%t(x) #Multiplication of matrix x with transposition of x
apply(x,1,sum) #Sum of each row
apply(x,2,sum) #Sum of each column
```
### Indexing/subsetting of Vectors, Arrays and Data Frames
This might be one of the most important part because manipulating and selecting data needs addition criteria. 
#### Vectors
```{r}
x <- c(1,12,15,NA,16,13,0,NA,NA)
names(x) <- c("Pl","Bt","Mu","Q","Kfs","Ky","Ol","Px","C")
x
```
Logical vector
```{r}
x[x>10] #all elements > 10 or NA
x[!is.na(x)] #all available elements
```
Numeric vetor with positive values
```{r}
x[1:5] #the first to five elements
x[c(1,5,6)] #1st, 5th and 7th elements
```
#### Matrices/Data Frames
