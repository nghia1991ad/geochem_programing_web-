### Seeking help
First step in doing any programming is to know where to seek help. Here demonstrate how to seek help in R programming. These keywords include: help(), ?, apropos and example.
```{r}
help(plot)
?plot
apropos("plot") #Commands related to "plot"
example(plot)
```
### Object types

### Numeric Vectors
#### Assignment
Assignment of several items to a vector is done using the combine function c:
```{r}
x <- c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7)
y <- c(x,0,x)
y
```
#### Vector Arithmetic
For vectors, calculations are made using basic arithmetic operators: + - * / ^. The use of these operators for two vectors of the same length is intuitive. In other cases, the elements of the shorter vector are recycled.
```{r}
x*2 #Intuitive operators of same length vectors
x*c(1,2) #Multiply is recycled, i.e. *1 *2 *1 *2 *1
```
#### Functions to Manipulate Numeric Vectors

#### Names
Each vector may have an attribute *names* (the length of the vector and names must be matching)
```{r}
x <- c(3,15,27)
names(x) <- c("Opx","Cpx","Pl")
x
```
#### Generating Regular Sequences
Using *colon*, *seq*, *rep*
```{r}
1:9
seq(30,22,-2)
x <- c(0,1)
rep(x,5)
seq(0,5,length.out = 30) #linspace equivalent
```
### Character Vectors
```{r}
paste("A","B","C",sep=";")
x <- c("A","B","C")
substring(x,1,4)
x <- c("Plagioclase","K-feldspar")
strsplit(x,"a")
```
### Arrays, Matrices, Data Frames
Data frames are data objects with observation as columns and cases in rows, and they can contain of any mode. Matrix is a table-like object with single mode (numeric, most commonly). Arrays are generalized matrices: single mode with any number of dimensions.
```{r}
x <- matrix(1:12,3,4)
x
y <- matrix(1:12,3,4,byrow=TRUE)
y
z <- array(c(x,y), dim = c(3,4,2))
z
```

```{r}
x
cat("Number of rows",nrow(x),"\n")
cat("Number of columns", ncol(x),"\n")
t(x) # transpose of x
x%*%t(x) #Multiplication of matrix x with transposition of x
apply(x,1,sum) #Sum of each row
apply(x,2,sum) #Sum of each column
```
### Indexing/subsetting of Vectors, Arrays and Data Frames
This might be one of the most important part because manipulating and selecting data needs addition criteria. 
#### Vectors
For more reference, see https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_vectors.htm.
```{r}
x <- c(1,12,15,NA,16,13,0,NA,NA)
names(x) <- c("Pl","Bt","Mu","Q","Kfs","Ky","Ol","Px","C")
x
```
Logical vector
```{r}
x[x>10] #all elements > 10 or NA
x[!is.na(x)] #all available elements
```
Numeric vetor with positive values
```{r}
x[1:5] #the first to five elements
x[c(1,5,6)] #1st, 5th and 7th elements
```
#### Matrices/Data Frames
Elements of a matrix are presented in the order [row, column]. If nothing is given for a *row* or *column*, it means no restriction. For more reference, see https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_matrices.htm and https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_data_frames.htm. For instance:
```{r}
x <- matrix(1:12,3,4)
x
x[1,] # all columns of the first row
x[,c(1,3)] # all rows of the first and third columns
x[1:3,-2] # all columns apart from the 2nd of rows 1-3
```
If the result is a single row or column, it is automatically converted to a vector. To prevent that, one can supply drop = F:
```{r}
x[1,,drop=F]
```
Manipulate matrix using index arrays:
```{r}
x <- matrix(1:20,4,5)
x
i <- matrix(c(1,2,3,3,2,1),3,2)
i
x[i] <- 0
x
```
### Lists
Lists are ordered collections of other objects, which do not have to be of the same mode or type.For more references, see https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_lists.htm.
```{r}
x1 <- c("Luckovice","9 km E of Blatna","disused quarry")
x2 <- "melamonzonite"
x3 <- c(47.31, 1.05, 14.94, 7.01, 8.46, 10.33)
names(x3) <- c("SiO2", "TiO2", "Al2O3", "FeO", "MgO", "CaO")
luckovice <- list(ID="Gbl-4",Locality=x1,Rock=x2,major=x3)
luckovice
```
```{r}
luckovice[[1]]
luckovice$Rock
luckovice[[2]][3]
luckovice$major[c("SiO2","Al2O3")]
```
### Factors
Factors are vector objects used for discrete classification (grouping) of components in other vectors of the same length, matrices or data frames, which is often served as categorical variables. For another reference, see https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_factors.htm.
```{r}
#Basic usage
x <- c("Pl","Bt","Pl","Pl","Kfs","Pl","Bt","Pl",NA)
factor(x)
ordered(x,c("Pl","Kfs","Bt"))
```
#### Conversion of numeric vectors to factors
In some cases, we want to divide the total range of a numeric vector x into a certain number of discrete groups and code the values in x accroding to the rank they fall in.
```{r}
numericVector <- runif(10, min = 1, max = 256 )
numericVector
cut(numericVector, 3)
cut(numericVector, 3, labels = c("low","med","high"))
cut(numericVector,breaks = c(1,100,200,256), labels = c("l","m","h"))
```
table(...) to counts the number of occurences of the givel level within the factor
```{r}
vt_cut <- cut(numericVector,breaks = c(1,100,200,256), labels = c("l","m","h"))
table(vt_cut)
```
tapply(x,INDEX,FUN,...):Apply a function to each cell of a ragged array, that is to each (non-empty) group of values given by a unique combination of the levels of certain factors. See https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/tapply.
```{r}
statef <- c("tas", "sa",  "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "nt",  "wa",  "wa",  "qld", "vic", "nsw", "vic", "qld", "qld", "sa",  "tas",  "sa",  "nt",  "wa",  "vic", "qld", "nsw", "nsw", "wa",  "sa",  "act", "nsw", "vic", "vic", "act")
incomes <- c(60, 49, 40, 61, 64, 60, 59, 54, 62, 69, 70, 42, 56, 61, 61, 61, 58, 51, 48, 65, 49, 49, 41, 48, 52, 46, 59, 46, 58, 43)

(incmeans <- tapply(incomes, statef, sum))
```
aggregate(x,by,FUN,..): Splits the data into subsets, computes summary statistics for each, and returns the result in a convenient form. See https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/aggregate
```{r}
data("ChickWeight")
aggregate(ChickWeight$weight,  by=list(chkID = ChickWeight$Diet), FUN=mean)
```
