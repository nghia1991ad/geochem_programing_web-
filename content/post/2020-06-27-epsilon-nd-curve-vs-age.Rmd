The epsilon Nd ($\epsilon_{Nd}$) is a widely used parameter to understand the processes of rock forming, i.e. petrogenetic processes from both geochemical and geochronological approach. By definition,  $\epsilon_{Nd}$ is the difference of $^{143}Nd/^{144}Nd$ of rock sample and 'chondritic uniform reservoir' at the time in the past T. For a rock of age T, $\epsilon_{Nd}(T)$ is the 'initial' value of $\epsilon_{Nd}$; the value at the time of crystallization of the rock, and $\epsilon_{Nd}(0)$ is the measured value (dePaolo, 1981). We use the same form as in (dePaolo, 1981) as we will the author's propose of $\epsilon_{Nd}$ curve, therefore, the value of $\epsilon_{Nd}$ is :

$$\epsilon_{Nd}(T)=10^4 \left[ \frac{(^{143}Nd/^{144}Nd)_{rock}(T)}{(^{143}Nd/^{144}Nd)_{CHUR}(T)} -1 \right]$$
